### Description

Very unique code. This is the only Webserver on the internet that uses the Winsock api (and where the source code is downloadable!) I needed a simple webserver without the Winsock OCX for my game's server, for some easy remote-admin. That's why this code also has the Basic Authenticationscheme implented. The code is a bit messy, but it's been tough to get it working anyways. I hope you people enjoy this code and that you may learn something from it (That's why I put it online :)

-Supports images

-Checks if pages exists (does not return 404 though)

-Has Basic Authentication functionality (run it and you'll see it)

-Pretty secure I believe ("/../" won't work)

-Accepts multiple connections!

One drawback: The events are based on two command buttons. Yes, I'm sorry. but I just don't like AddressOfs, hooks, callbacks and whatever... they just are too crashy when you're beginning with something like this...

I used someones 2 class modules found on this site... I forgot the author of it. if anyone knows it, let me kow. Credit where credit is due :)

Anyway, enjoy!
